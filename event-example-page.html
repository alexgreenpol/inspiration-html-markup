                                    an installation of handcrafted guitars by
                                    the local company, Prisma.
                                </p>

                                    In 2014, San Diego native Nicholas Pourfard
                                    started Prisma Guitars, a company that
                                    repurposes old skateboards into electric
                                    guitars. Using ingenuity and curiosity,
                                    Pourfard discovered the seven-color-dyed
                                    hard rock maple veneers of skateboards make
                                    the perfect material for crafting guitars.
                                    Removing the skateboard's grip tape reveals
                                    a colorful, unique pattern for a
                                    one-of-a-kind guitar. Paired with top-tier
                                    hardware, Prisma Guitars are functional
                                    artworks, each with a distinct design. Over
                                    the years, Pourfard and his team have built
                                    and sold hundreds of guitars, sharing their
                                    passion with people around the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the center of this installation is a
                                    guitar that's a collaboration piece between
                                    Prisma Guitars and world-renowned artist
                                    James Marshall, known as “Dalek”. Best known
                                    for his Space Monkey character, Dalek
                                    hand-painted five Prisma Guitars as pieces
                                    of functional art. Each is an original
                                    collectible work of art. The guitar features
                                    a backplate with an engraving of Dalek's
                                    famous space Monkey, Dalek's signature, the
                                    authenticity of 1/1, and the guitar's unique
                                    serial number.
                                </p>

                                    The backdrop spotlighting these beautifully
                                    crafted guitars was hand-painted by local
                                    creative duo Grand Prestoz. You can find the
                                    work of Oscar Rios and David Mondragon, the
                                    friends behind Grand Prestoz, on the wall of
                                    restaurants, breweries, and shops in many
                                    San Diego neighborhoods such as North Park,
                                    Mission Hills, or Hillcrest.

                                    while sonically, it's undoubtedly the real

                                    What makes Prisma Guitars so unique? All
                                    guitars are handcrafted by Luthier Nicholas
                                    Pourfard and his team in California. In his
                                    creative process, Nick recycles retired
                                    skateboard decks which traditionally consist
                                    of seven color-dyed plys of hard rock maple
                                    pressed together. Once the grip tape is
                                    removed, and the hard rock maple is crafted
                                    for the guitar, the native color-dyed
                                    patterns emerge. These masterfully crafted
                                    instruments are also adorned with top-tier
                                    hardware to ensure the utmost quality tone
                                    and playability.
